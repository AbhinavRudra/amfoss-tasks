# INTROSPECTION
## SELF INTRODUCTION 
Hello everyone, I'm Abhinav M Nair, currently a first-year student pursuing Electronics and Computer Engineering (EAC).
I have a little experience with coding. I started with Python and hope to expand my range of languages. 
Apart from coding, I am also interested in swimming and badminton. 
Quantum computing also grabs my interest. I would like to know more about the computers that run on qubits. This curiosity is one of the reasons that drove me into EAC.

## WHY MUST YOU CHOOSE ME?
I've known how to code using Python for a while now, and I've always been attracted to problem-solving, but I was unable to complete it to a notable extent.
Learning how things work in this digital world is an absolute resource I need. Therefore, I think amfoss will help me understand the building blocks of the systems that are built digitally. I believe that my consistent interest in learning more about such topics and my curiosity together burn in the same flame, which can make me a good selection for the team.
In conclusion, I wish to be part of amfoss where I can learn from and support every member of the group.

## WHAT'S YOUR PLAN FOR THE NEXT 6 MONTHS?
In the next six months, I want to become better at coding. When I tried attempting hacker-rank questions, I realized that I was really behind on using this skill.
So, I wish to improve my problem-solving skills, start jumping to more advanced skills, and improve myself. Also, knowing that AI is going to become one of the top technologies in the future, I want to explore everything about it and be part of its making.
If I'm selected for amfoss I will improve every day to be the person I want to be. Also, focus on my studies, getting a good CGPA, and developing good communication skills

## HOW WOULD YOU CONTRIBUTE BACK TO THE CLUB?
I will do my best to support the club and its members with the projects and the varied tasks.
I would do my best to build some great projects built in the group.

## Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
No, this type of selection process gives candidates like us a month to learn new topics, attempt tasks, and build a good level of confidence with the senior members' support.
