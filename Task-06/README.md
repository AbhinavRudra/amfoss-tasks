Creating a Discord bot was something completely new for me. I started by setting up the virtual environment and then made the bot. At first, I made it respond to simple messages and used the request-get method to fetch data. I added commands for live scores and help. I faced a problem with the bot not responding to commands, but I found a solution by searching on Google. I also had to look up how to save data in a CSV file. Overall, I had to deal with a lot of new things and errors. Thankfully, Google helped me out.
